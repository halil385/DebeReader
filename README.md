üìñ About The Project
This project offers a streamlined interface for Ek≈üi S√∂zl√ºk's daily popular entries ("debe"). To ensure high performance and prevent unnecessary traffic to the source website, it automatically scrapes and caches the entries in a database once a day. The frontend features a unique Visual Studio IDE theme, providing a familiar and engaging experience for developers.

üöÄ Features
Daily Scraping: A background job automatically scrapes the latest popular entries every day.

Database Caching: All scraped data is stored in a PostgreSQL database to ensure fast load times and prevent re-scraping.

Date Archive: Users can browse and read the popular entries from previous days.

Responsive Design: A clean and functional UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Unique VS Code Theme: A developer-centric, interactive theme that mimics the Visual Studio IDE.

Decoupled Architecture: A modern architecture with a separate frontend and a backend API.
